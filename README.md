**Portmarks** lets you create portable HTML bookmark files for any web page. Your bookmarks work everywhere—no browser sync, no cloud dependency, just tiny files you own. Free and open source.

- **Universal:** Bookmarks are simple HTML files that redirect to your saved page. Use them on any device or platform.
- **Private:** No cloud, no tracking, no account required. You own your bookmarks.
- **Bookmarklet:** Portmarks is a bookmarklet that works in any modern browser and it's easy to install. Just drag the button to your bookmarks bar!

## Quick Start

2. Open the `install.html` file in your browser.
3. Drag the **Portmarks** button to your bookmarks bar.
4. Click the bookmarklet on any page to download a portable bookmark file.
